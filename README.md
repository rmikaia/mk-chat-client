# mk-chat-client
`mk-chat-client` is the client side of a legacy chat project (2013) that I migrate on github. This was a school project and I want to refund it to the actual Java tendacy.
It needs the server part to work correctly. You can found it [here](https://github.com/rmikaia/mk-chat-server)
